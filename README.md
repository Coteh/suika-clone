# suika-clone

A clone of a game that's been [taking over the world by storm](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/10/random-switch-exclusive-watermelon-game-goes-viral-eshop-downloads-skyrocket), dubbed "Japan's hardest game". It goes by the name Suika Game, or Watermelon Game.

It's essentially a variation of 2048/Threes, but with 2D ball physics and a bit more RNG.
